In response to more than 3,000 same-sex marriages certified in San Francisco and a recent Massachusetts court ruling requiring that state to offer such marriages, President Bush said Tuesday that he would push for a constitutional amendment to define marriage as the union between a man and a woman. Both leading Democratic presidential contenders, Sens. John Edwards of North Carolina and John Kerry of Massachusetts, have said they oppose gay marriage, but add that they will not support amending the constitution.

Meanwhile, gay rights groups, including the Triangle Freedom to Marry Coalition, assailed Bush's announcement Tuesday as an attempt to use the Constitution to discriminate against gays and lesbians.

"The Hawaii Supreme Court has become the first in the country to rule that a state may not be able to prohibit gays from marrying. The decision gives broad protection under the state's constitution to homosexuals.

The court said any state regulation that sets up limits based on sex can be defended only if the state shows it has ""compelling"" reasons. That is the toughest legal test for a state to meet and traditionally has required it to prove that public safety is at stake.

The ruling Wednesday, which lawyers on both sides of the case describe as ""groundbreaking,"" marked the second time in the past year that state courts have found protection for gays in state constitutions. In September, the Kentucky Supreme Court safeguarded privacy rights for homosexuals by striking down an anti-sodomy law.

The rulings illustrate how activists on a range of issues often turn to state courts for vindication. Many state constitutions offer broader protections for individual rights than the federal Constitution.

The ruling reinstated a lawsuit by three Honolulu-area homosexual couples, who were denied marriage licenses.

The court ruled that under the state constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the laws any sex-based classification is ""suspect,"" putting it in a special category traditionally reserved for regulations that make distinctions based on race.

"The network quashed videos Clinton shot in support of a Washington State referendum on gay marriage, BuzzFeed reported.

Clinton, who works as a ""special correspondent"" for NBC News, likely was prohibited from the advocacy to avoid allegations of bias.

The videos were to be posted on TheFour.com, a site dedicated to marriage-equality issues that were on the ballot in four states on Nov. 6.

In the ads, Clinton says everyone should have the right to marry, a source told the website.

But in the end, the movement did fine without Clinton's public support - gay marriage got the green light from voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington. And in Minnesota, a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between a man and a woman failed.

In 2011 - prior to her job as a reporter - Clinton spoke in support of marriage equality in New York.

BuzzFeed reported that Clinton's gig at NBC News, as well as her earlier advocacy for gay marriage, are indicators that the former first daughter is considering a foray into political life.

"Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. apologized to President Obama for hastening him into an endorsement of same-sex marriage, several people briefed on the exchange said Thursday, even as the White House sought to capitalize in the campaign on Mr. Obama's long-awaited expression of support.

In an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Obama on Wednesday, hours before the president confirmed his own support, Mr. Biden expressed regret for a statement endorsing same-sex marriage that went considerably further than the president's views on the matter and scrambled the White House's calculation for confronting the charged social issue.

As the president traveled to the West Coast on Thursday, where in Seattle he said Americans should have the chance to succeed ''no matter who you love,'' his presumptive challenger, Mitt Romney, and Republican leaders in Congress, tried, with limited success, to steer the focus of the presidential campaign back to the nation's sluggish economy.

When Mr. Romney addressed hundreds of donors and other supporters at a pair of campaign stops in Nebraska, one of the nation's most reliable Republican states, he steered clear of the topic of same-sex marriage, underscoring Republican caution over the shifting politics of the gay marriage debate. On Capitol Hill, Speaker John A. Boehner deflected questions about same-sex marriage, declaring: ''The president can talk about it all he wants. I'm going to stay focused on what the American people want us to focus on, and that's jobs.''

"The United Church of Christ became the first mainline Christian denomination to support same-sex marriage officially when its general synod passed a resolution on Monday affirming ''equal marriage rights for couples regardless of gender.''

The resolution was adopted in the face of efforts to amend the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. It was both a theological statement and a protest against discrimination, said the Rev. John H. Thomas, the president and general minister of the denomination, which has 6,000 congregations and 1.3 million members.

''On this July 4, the United Church of Christ has courageously acted to declare freedom, affirming marriage equality, affirming the civil rights of gay -- of same-gender -- couples to have their relationships recognized as marriages by the state, and encouraging our local churches to celebrate those marriages,'' Mr. Thomas said at a news conference after the vote by the General Synod.

The synod's decisions are not binding and the vote will not require pastors to provide marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples. Some United Church of Christ ministers already perform such ceremonies.

While the United Church of Christ has not had the widespread divisions other major denominations have experienced over homosexuality, some member churches had said that such a vote could prompt them to leave the denomination, and one group called for Mr. Thomas's resignation when he announced his support of the resolution.

"For instance, a poll taken last month for the National Annenberg Election Survey at the University of Pennsylvania showed that just over half of people ages 18 to 29 would oppose a law in their states that would allow lesbians and gay men to marry a same-sex partner. That compares with 61 percent of 30- to 44-year-olds; two-thirds of 45- to 64-year-olds; and 81 percent of those 65 and older.

The poll also found that fewer than half of those younger than 30 supported a federal constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.

Experts say the difference in attitudes can largely be tracked to young people's exposure to homosexuality in everyday life.

"Exactly how many same-sex couples are seeking divorces is not clear - nor is it clear whether any gay divorces have become final - because not all counties keep track of which divorce filings are from same-sex couples.

The first gay-divorce case in Suffolk County, which includes Boston, was filed Wednesday by a male couple who exchanged vows May 22, five days after same-sex marriage was legalized.

One partner, 33, is a religious educator from Boston; the other, 39, is a professor based in Washington. Since then, the couple said in their divorce filing, ""our interests have grown in different directions."" Each man signed a settlement attesting that the marriage had ""irretrievably broken down.""

The most difficult part of the settlement appeared to be custody of their three cats, who will live exclusively with the professor.

Massachusetts began sanctioning gay marriages May 17, six months after a landmark ruling by the state's Supreme Judicial Court.

According to the state Registry of Vital Records, at least 4,266 gay-marriage certificates have since been issued, though there is a lag time in the records, and hundreds more may have wed this year.

$250,000 in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages. Beane has 20 days to respond to the suit.

"ALBANY - A state lawyer urged a skeptical appeals court yesterday to maintain New York's ban against same-sex marriage, arguing that the Legislature, not the courts, should decide the issue.

But the lawyer, Peter Schiff of the state attorney general's office, also admitted that the state has no ""compelling interest"" in stopping gay marriages.

The arguments heard by the panel of five judges are likely to shape the decision on whether same-sex couples can marry under the state Constitution.

The case is likely to find its way to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court.

The potential scandal may be enough to affect Tuesday's vote on the state constitutional ban on gay marriage or the domestic-partnerships initiative, some political watchers say. But who might benefit is anybody's guess.

Especially since gay marriage and benefits are usually bedrock issues and not prone to wavering opinions.

"Gay marriage advocates on Thursday urged a federal appeals court to reject a bid to reconsider last month's ruling striking down California's voter-approved ban on same-sex nuptials.

In court papers filed with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for same-sex couples argued that another review of the legal challenge to Proposition 8 is ""an unnecessary step"" that will delay the outcome. San Francisco city officials also filed documents asking the court to reject the latest legal volley by Proposition 8 backers.

""Two federal courts have already found Proposition 8 unconstitutional,"" gay marriage supporters wrote. ""Yet plaintiffs -- along with thousands of other gay and lesbian Californians -- still suffer the daily indignity and humiliation of having the state designate their relationships as second-class pairings unworthy of the name 'marriage.'""

A three-judge 9th Circuit panel in February ruled 2-1 that Proposition 8 violated the equal protection rights of same-sex couples because without legal or social justification it stripped them of an established right to marry in California.

But Proposition 8 backers last week asked the 9th Circuit to rehear the case with an 11-judge panel, an ""en banc"" review. A majority of the court's 25 full-time judges must vote to rehear the case, a move most legal experts say is unlikely given the 9th Circuit's current ideological makeup.

The legal maneuvering postpones the eventual likelihood of the U.S. Supreme Court being asked to address the Proposition 8 challenge.

"When leaders of the United Methodist Church's Northern California and Nevada region meet here on June 15, they will begin grappling with the unusual decision of whether to charge 68 ministers with violating church law for having jointly blessed a same-sex union in January.

The ceremony was public, held in the convention center here, with more than 1,000 people attending and wide news coverage.

A church spokesman said that never before had so many ministers faced the possibility of a formal charge of disobedience, which could lead to a church trial. Trials themselves, in which a conviction can carry penalties as severe as removal of ministerial credentials, have been rare -- until recently -- in the denomination, which has 8.5 million members.

In March, the Rev. Greg Dell, a minister in Chicago, was suspended from office by an ecclesiastical court after it found him guilty of violating church law for having blessed the union of two gay men.

A year earlier, the Rev. Jimmy Creech, of Omaha, Neb., was acquitted after conducting a ceremony for two women. But Mr. Creech's bishop removed him from his pulpit. An official complaint, which can lead to a trial, has been filed against Mr. Creech for a same-sex union he recently performed in North Carolina.

These events illustrate the escalating tension within many mainline Protestant churches over how to respond to gay and lesbian members. Among Methodists, the second-largest Protestant denomination after the Southern Baptist Convention, the debate has focused on clergy members' blessing same-sex unions.

New York's highest court heard arguments in two cases on Tuesday that could have profound effects on the  battle over same-sex marriage.

The cases, which the court, the New York State Court of Appeals, is considering jointly, concern relatively narrow executive and administrative orders in recent years that extended benefits like health insurance to same-sex spouses of government employees who married in jurisdictions where such  marriages are legal, and, in one county, required local officials to treat same-sex couples as married.

But a broad enough ruling by the Court of Appeals could force businesses and local governments in the state to recognize out-of-state marriages between same-sex couples, effectively legalizing the unions of thousands of New Yorkers who were married in Vermont, Iowa, parts of Canada and other places where same-sex marriage is legal.",en,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Senate vote is expected to quickly reignite one of the most emotional and politically contentious issues in contemporary politics. Already, two initiatives are being circulated to put a constitutional ban on gay marriage before voters next year.

But whether Thursday's dramatic action goes down as the first in a wave of growing legislative support for same-sex marriage or as a high-water mark for gay rights now rests with a handful of moderates who could risk political suicide by supporting it. Almost all of the 10 Assembly Democrats who abstained or voted against gay marriage in June face tough elections next year in swing districts or represent heavily Latino or Catholic constituencies that generally oppose it.

"The Palm Beach County School District made headlines last year when it started offering domestic-partner benefits, but the premiums are so expensive - more than twice than for a traditional couple - that not a single employee has signed up.

The district expected from 60 to 100 employees to apply.

Participation usually is low because most public employers don't subsidize domestic partner benefits. But what sets the school district apart is that the district's 12,000 teachers aren't eligible.

Unlike Broward and Miami-Dade school districts, where all employees can buy coverage, only school administrators and certain non-union secretaries - about 1,500 people - can qualify in Palm Beach County.

School board member Monroe Benaim, who pushed for domestic-partner benefits as a way to stay competitive with neighboring school districts, hopes the pilot is a stopgap measure until a more comprehensive program is approved.

"But in the majority opinion, Justice Steven H. Levinson wrote that ""marriage is a basic civil right"" and that ""on its face and as applied,"" the Hawaii law ""denies same-sex couples access to the marital status and its concomitant rights and benefits.""

Legal experts said the case would not wind up in the United States Supreme Court because it was based solely on state law. But if Hawaii were to recognize gay marriages, the decision would have implications nationwide.

Crossing State Lines

No state currently allows such marriages. But each state recognizes marriages performed in another state.  Thus, unless other states acted to change current practices, gay couples married in Hawaii would have to be recognized as married couples in other states, thereby entitling them to the tax breaks, health benefits and survivor benefits that accrue to married partners.

"The Episcopal Church, which has been strained by gay-rights issues since the election of an openly gay bishop in New Hampshire eight years ago, is now divided over how to respond to the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York.

As a result, gay and lesbian Episcopalians will be allowed on Sunday to get married by priests in Brooklyn and Queens, but not in the Bronx or Manhattan or on Staten Island; in Syracuse but not in Albany.

That is because the church has not taken a firm position nationally on same-sex marriage, leaving local bishops with wide latitude to decide what priests may do when the law takes effect in New York State. In the state, with six Episcopal dioceses, the bishops are split: two have given the green light for priests to officiate at same-sex marriages, one has said absolutely not, two are undecided and one has staked out a middle ground, allowing priests to bless, but not officiate at, weddings of gay men and lesbians.

The Episcopal Church, known as one of the most welcoming to gay men and lesbians among mainline Protestant denominations, finds itself in an uneasy position on the issue -- embracing neither the clear stance against same-sex marriage taken by Roman Catholic, evangelical Protestant, Muslim, Mormon and Orthodox Jewish leaders, nor the supportive position of Reform Jewish, Unitarian Universalist and many liberal Protestant leaders. The Episcopal Church is a small denomination -- the church claims 172,623 members in New York State -- but is also prestigious and influential.

"The ongoing battle over redefinition of marriage threatens to shatter a long-standing, popular approach to personal faith and biblical morality.

For several generations, most Americans have embraced what could be described as the Goldilocks attitude toward religion: affirming faith choices that seemed not too soft but not too hard, not too hot but not too cool. Majorities viewed easy-going moderation and comforting compromise as the religious path that counted as ""just right.""

Conservative Judaism -- the ""middle branch"" of the ancient faith -- always exemplified the ""Goldilocks"" orientation with its emphasis on the ""sweet spot"" between stringencies of Orthodox observance and the anything-goes adaptability of Reform. But just before Passover, the Conservative movement's  flagship institution, The Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS), announced a controversial decision highlighting the painful contradictions of middle way religions.

Following the findings  of an expert panel filed last December, JTS signaled its intention to accept openly gay candidates for the rabbinate and to raise no objection to their involvement in same-sex commitment ceremonies.  For a movement that still stresses time-honored standards of Sabbath observance and kosher food, this represents a stunning break with tradition. A spiritual leader proudly, publicly promoting consumption of pork would never fit in with the Conservative rabbinate, but this same denomination now will sanction rabbis who call unblushing communal attention to their personal practice of sexual relations that the Torah describes as ""abomination.""

"The Feb. 10 Commentary article by lesbian Amy Adams Squire Strongheart was the most ridiculous theology I have ever read. Her delusion that the term ""eunuch"" could possibly mean gay - thus affirmed by Jesus - is absurd. It is not a point of biblical interpretation; it is simply garbage theology.

The Holy Scriptures do clearly state that homosexuals are people of a depraved mind (Romans 1), so this would explain her interpretation and the fact that this blasphemy was allowed in the Post-Dispatch. Homosexuality is condemned by God and will only yield death and eternal damnation for these people. Homosexuals need to confess their sins and receive forgiveness, not attempt to rationalize it with nonsense theology.

It is time for Christians to offer tough love to a people who have a life expectancy on this Earth of less than 40 years, and an eternal life in hell. The homosexual lifestyle is a ticket to destruction.  Rev. Dale J. Pritchard Hillsboro, Ill.  Amy Adams Squire Strongheart's Feb. 10 Commentary article about same-sex marriages made a case to prove homosexuality is affirmed in the Bible. She is wrong again. The eunuchs the book of Matthew 19:4-12 is referring to are men who were castrated by other men as a punishment or converted men of a pagan religion priesthood or men born impotent. Never, in any case, does it describe the gay lifestyle.  Theo Parmer Sr.  Florissant For some time, I have been following the obvious overexposure of the sexual orientation of Amy Adams Squire Strongheart in the Post-Dispatch. I have been trying to determine what purpose the paper has in publishing these outlandish articles by an avowed lesbian. I now realize that succeeding articles have become nothing more than succes de scandale.
