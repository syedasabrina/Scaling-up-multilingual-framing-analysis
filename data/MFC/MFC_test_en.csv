Listeners have become neighbors, and Mohamed said it's not unusual to have people casually drop by the second-floor studio to meet the voices behind the mic.

Sagal Radio is a community-based nonprofit that broadcasts radio programs every Friday, Saturday and Sunday in six different languages --- English, Somali, Amharic, Karen, Bhutanese/Nepali and Swahili. Programs are broadcast in various languages at different times during those days. It also streams online.

" The attorney, Spencer McLaughlin, is a Republican legislator from Orange County and a former deputy executive director of the New York City Human Rights Commission under Ed Koch. That West would turn to a Republican for advice was a surprise to the people who thought the mayor, who was elected on the Green Party line, was a radical liberal activist about to turn the town into a socialist enclave. In his reply to West, McLaughlin noted that the law is unclear. ''That's because the laws were written around the late 19th century, and no one ever conceived of wanting to do this then,'' McLaughlin said recently. The attorney ended his memo to mayor saying, ''That's a very long-winded explanation of why you can't perform a same-sex marriage, but does not address the issue of whether you should or not.''

"
The ruling, which did not address the constitutionality of the state's marriage laws, is the country's first permanent injunction issued by a court that bars a public official from conducting same-sex marriages, according to the Lambda Legal Education and Defense Fund, a national gay rights group. The California Supreme Court heard arguments late last month on a similar case, against Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco, and a ruling is pending.

In his decision yesterday, Justice E. Michael Kavanagh of State Supreme Court in Ulster County took exception to the notion that public officials like the New Paltz mayor, Jason West, could resist laws that they believe to be unconstitutional.

''That an elected official may willfully violate a law any time he or she believes it is unconstitutional has profound and unsettling implications,'' Justice Kavanagh wrote. ''This view, if accepted, would mean that the mayor is a law unto himself.''

E. Joshua Rosenkranz, a lawyer for Mayor West, said he intended to appeal the decision. ''This does not stop with Judge Kavanagh,'' Mr. Rosenkranz said. ''This is only the beginning of the process.''

In addition to the injunction, sought by a trustee on the New Paltz village board, Mr. West also faces criminal charges for the more than 20 same-sex marriage ceremonies he performed on a platform outside the low brick village hall in late February. The Ulster County district attorney charged Mr. West with the criminal misdemeanor of solemnizing marriages for people without licenses.

"Missouri voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the State Constitution barring gay marriage, becoming the first state to answer what has become a growing question since same-sex marriage became legal in Massachusetts.

With 93 percent of precincts reporting, the amendment had garnered 70 percent of the vote.

Voters in at least 9 other states -- and perhaps as many as 12 -- are expected to consider similar amendments this fall, so advocates on both sides of the debate were intensely watching Missouri's results, anxious about what they might say about voters elsewhere in the weeks ahead.

"State Senate President Stephen Sweeney's tardiness in supporting same-sex marriage legislation means the latest bill will likely die on Gov. Christie's desk, if not before.

Had Sweeney campaigned for it, a different outcome might have occurred in 2010, when a similar bill fell seven votes short of the 21 needed for Senate passage. Instead, he abstained.

""I made a bonehead decision. I did the wrong thing,"" Sweeney said Thursday in an interview with the Inquirer Editorial Board. In 2010, then-Gov. Jon Corzine promised to sign a gay-marriage bill if it passed before he left office. But Christie is taking the opposite point of view.

Sweeney said the measure is still ""worth the fight."" But he knows it will be very difficult to get the votes needed to override Christie's virtually certain veto, even though both legislative chambers are controlled by Democrats. Many legislators are afraid to take on this volatile issue.

Sweeney, a powerful Gloucester County Democrat, personally sponsored the latest marriage equality bill, which was introduced earlier this week. But the senator's move prompted some skeptics to accuse Sweeney, a likely U.S. Senate candidate in 2014, of political posturing.
