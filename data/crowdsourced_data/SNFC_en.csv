Little did I know the implications of doing it this way. Not going to a private clinic I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m not signing no paper work to give me parental rights over the unborn child. Neither were we married. So when the birth finally came. Amongst all the happiness of my little boy being here and healthy. There was disappointment watching A (my ex) sign his birth certificate as she birthed him. And I couldn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t. Discussions were had between me and A about me gaining parental rights. We found that if she agreed for me to have them, we could pay a small court fee and I would have the rights I so wanted over my boy. Time went on and she still never got round to allowing this to happen. To the point where 18 months after his birth. The relationship broke down. It started off ok. I was allowed to see him. He stayed at mine. Visited my mom. And was allowed to continue to be apart of my family. Until she got in a new relationship. She has now decided to tell me that her new partner will be adopting my son and he will have no clue that he once had two moms My heart is breaking not seeing him. Citizens advice were no help.

I think it's important that we follow up with our elected officials and not leave these children for dead. The United States must do better. Please see my letter below to my Congressman. If you are in the US, please feel free to borrow my letter and write your own elected officials: \--------------------------------- Congressman Jeffries: It has been awhile since this concern has been given attention by our nation's media, and I think it's important that we do not forget. And even more important that action be taken to correct a grave injustice. Immigrants have the right to seek asylum in the United States. No, our country is under no obligation to accept everyone. But we must treat these individuals / families humanely, and live up to our nation's values as so eloquently inscribed at the Statue of Liberty: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free"". What happened under the Trump administration was incredibly tragic. Children, under the age of 12, separated from their mothers and fathers, locked away in detention centers, indefinitely, a number of them separated from their mothers and fathers FOREVER. I am writing you with a request: (1) That we follow up on these minors who have been indefinitely detained, and not leave them for dead, simply because their parents sought a better life for them; (2) That we pass legislation to treat immigrant populations HUMANELY; (3) That we find a better way to manage the influx of immigrant children and look out for their best interests; and (4) That we do everything in our power to unite these children with their parents, where possible; and (5) That never again, do we force 3-year olds to appear in court before an immigration judge, without adequate legal representation or adequate care. Please see to it that the children who have been detained indefinitely are not left for dead. We must do better as a nation. Thank you,",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,en

Similar results were obtained in Germany, the Netherlands and France, where holding a ‘native’ European name substantially increased the average probability of a job call-back. A French study found that a candidate with a Muslim-sounding name was two and a half times less likely to receive a job interview call-back, in comparison to a person with a Christian-sounding name.

"Dear All, Around 9 years ago, being young and foolish (not that they are necessarily correlated), I was arrested for a misdemeanor. As soon as the cops surrounded me, I completely broke down in tears and apologized profusely. They proceeded to take a pic of me and took some of my possessions as a proof for the court, though they never took a fingerprint. I did not know about my Miranda rights and was confessing everything straightforwardly and transparently to the officer that arrested and questioned me. Seeing a distressed kid who obviously made a mistake without any prior offenses seem to noticeably soften him. Not sure if that was the reason, but my arrest was never charged. Doing a county court case search returns a negative result for this incident, even though I can still easily find my traffic citations from these county court records, or records of other people's with a similar misdemeanor offense. I was never asked to report to the court. Fast forward 9 years, I have never been in trouble with the law, and have become a scholar with a Ph.D. and have recently been approved of NIW via I-140. Now I am finally in the middle of applying for a status change for a permanent residency through I-485, but noticed that one of the questions inquires about my arrest history. From what I gathered, submitting an I-485 prompts an FBI background search‚Äî both name and fingerprints. (My research seems to indicate that name search alone is quite inaccurate.) Given my circumstances, what is the likelihood that FBI background check will discover my arrest record? Also, do you believe that answering truthfully may jeopardize my chance to obtain a permanent residency? I'm concerned that it may disqualify me based on moral turpitude (not sure if my misdemeanor falls into that category or not)",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,en
"Dear Reddit My name is Mark and I am a Masters of psychology student at Victoria University in Australia. I am completing my research thesis on resilience in same sex families. Overall, results indicate that children of same sex families fare just as good as children of heterosexual families on a range of socioemotional measures However, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that children of same sex families may experience stigma and discrimination based on their parent‚Äôs sexuality. There is a paucity of research about the adolescence experience of stigma. For my thesis, I will be interviewing participants over the age of 18 who have a parent in a same sex relationship who reflect on their past experiences of experiencing stigma. These questions should not be viewed as elements that could further lead to stigmatization of rainbow families, nor should they be seen as discrediting families or objecting to the rights of same sex couples to raise children. Rather, by asking such questions we may shed light as to how a heterosexist framework perpetuates stigma for students with same sex parents. By learning more, we may be able to help reduce stigma and discrimination in the environment and identify possible interventions to diminish the effects of stigma felt that effects the entire family I would greatly appreciate your support in this project.

"Hello everyone, I am a M.A. candidate at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and I am recruiting participants for my study on how LGBTQ+ fathers talk with their children on the topic of human sexual anatomy and physiology. I want to learn more about how and when conversations about human sexual anatomy and physiology take place, and the reasoning behind having or not having the conversations. In order to participate, you must be at least 18 years old, identify as LGBTQ+, a father of at least one child, and the child must have lived with you part time or is currently living with you at least part time. This study consists of completing one screening survey and one study survey. The screening survey will ask eligibility questions. If you are eligible for the study, you will then receive an email with a Study ID and a link to the study survey. The study survey will ask questions about how you talk to your child about sexual anatomy and physiology and the child‚Äö√Ñ√¥s own body. The study in total is estimated to take approximately 30 minutes. In appreciation for your participation, participants will receive a $10 gift card for Amazon if they fully complete the study survey. To receive compensation, participants need to insert their Study ID they will receive after completing the screening survey in the study survey, and they must fully complete the study survey. Participation is voluntary. You may refuse to answer any question or withdraw from the study at any point in time. All information collected is confidential. The only identifying information that will need to be entered is the Study ID in order for participants to receive the gift card.

"Hello fellow Redditors, I recently created my Express Entry profile a few days ago after receiving my IELTS scores. My CRS score is 441, which is with maximum IELTS scores. I am unsure if I can increase it further without a job offer or something similar. I am hopeful that I will receive a PNP ITA from OINP (Ontario)/AINP (Alberta)/BCPNP (British Columbia) as I have expressed interest in all provinces in my Express Entry profile. I would like to hear from other Redditors about their experiences. Do I have a chance of receiving a PNP nomination, or should I try to obtain a job offer from a Canadian employer or pursue a certificate course so I can select Two or More degrees? (I would prefer not to wait for WES to evaluate my degree again.) Here are some additional details about my profile: * My IELTS scores are maxed out (Listening: 9, Reading: 9, Writing 7.5, Speaking: 7.5) * I work in tech as a full-stack developer (NOC Code 21234) but NOC 21232 also suits my profile. * I have over 6 years of experience in the industry. * I have a bachelor's degree in technology. * I am under 30 and do not have a spouse.

Hello guys! I hope you guys are doing well. I have some questions in regards to my brother's case. Summary: My brother got a misdemeanor offense to Count 2 Aiding and Abetting Aliens to Elude Examination and Inspection by Immigration Officers of the United States. He went to jail for 60 days only and had no probation at all. He went to the United States last 2015 and he got the misdemeanor in 2016. I know that within 5 years of committing a crime with a green card holder could get you in deportation and we know it's a crime for the moral turpitude that makes him deportable also. That's the last time he committed a crime and he is doing good now. We already went to 2 different attorneys to check if he can apply for naturalization and they both said no for now but he is likely to have more chance of renewing his green card again in 2025. We are okay with that as long as he is not going to be in the removal proceeding. We asked the attorneys if he is allowed to travel outside of the United States for a short vacation (1-2weeks) and they said it's okay to travel and not a problem. What do you think guys? We are okay now with just renewing his green card if he can't really apply for naturalization. But is he really allowed to travel outside of the US just for vacation? Is there gonna be a problem when he re-entered the US? Just want to know more opinions from different people. Thank you guys!,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,en

"Hello hello, My partner and I (two women) are starting a family. We went to the fertility doctor and are going to start trying this year. One problem : the sperm. We feel like before we can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even start because we can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t get passed this one GIANT question mark. Should we ask a good friend that could be involved as a ‚Äö√Ñ√∫fun uncle‚Äö√Ñ√π type but not a parent? Pro: Our kids would be able to know where they came from. This person is great and fits all of our criteria more than any donor we‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve seen. They would respect our wishes to be as involved or not as we want. Con: This feels complicated. There are so many ways it can go wrong. This person is in our lives, so as it stands our children will know him. Will our friends think of our kids as also his? Will our kids feel abandoned that he is not a parent to them? Especially when they see him as a great parent to his own children? Will this excaserbate their need for a father figure because they are not getting it from him? Option 2: Donor Sperm. The biggest decision for us is whether the children will be able to contact the donor when they turn 18. I have been trying to do research on what is better for kids ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ to know their history/donor/genetics or to be better off not complicating the situation. What if they contact this person we have very little information about and they are terrible? Or what if they can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t reach them at all so it was just an empty promise? Does anyone have advice or resources? What was your experience like choosing sperm and what/who if anything helped you make this huge decision for someone that isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t even here yet?

"Hey guys! First and foremost, I appreciate any feedback I may get on this, if any. So the big question is how do I get to Canada and be able to work? Some background on my situation- my girlfriend is Canadian and is here on a green card. It expires in two years, so we have time, but it‚Äôs never too early to plan. We have a baby on the way as well. We have decided (for personal reasons) Canada is the best move for us and our little family. Through my research, Canada will recognize us as domestic partners (we have lease documentation since we have been together, bank accounts, etc) so there shouldn‚Äôt be an issue proving we are legit. Not to mention our child that is coming haha. Anyway, from my research it seems like she will have to prove she can provide for me when we first move up there- which is no issue, we have money in the bank and her family has a business where she can immediately start work at a good salary. With all this said, it looks like I have to essentially live there for a year without work and not get into trouble, request government assistance, etc. before I can apply for a work visa. My issue is that I am admittedly a bit of a workaholic and also with a child I feel it is super unfair to expect her to provide for the three of us. Our savings is good, but not enough to where I feel comfortable not working for an entire year. Does anyone know if this is something an immigration lawyer could help us sort out before making the jump so I am not unemployed?

"Hi all! Not sure if this is the right place to post about this, hoping it is okay for me to ask this! I design and handmade modern baby books, right now it is your traditional mom and dad keepsake, with prompts referring to both parents. But I would love to make an alternative version for same sex parents, as I have had a few inquiries about it and I always feel so bad when I tell them I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t currently offer one. :( So here I am, because I don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t currently know any same sex couples who are also expecting/new parents, I turn to reddit in the hopes of getting some insights . In the standard baby book, it typically will refer to mom and dad, I think it would be okay to change that to parents. But I am at a loss of how to word the about parent pages, is it weird to have two pages that says about mom /about dad or should I do about mommy/about momma to decipher the difference? How do you guys usually refer to each other in a parent scenario? I hope this is the right way to ask this question Ô£ø√º√≤√ñ Also are there any special moments that would be unique that you may want to remember?

However, my dad passed away in June and we are realizing after his death that he had been in same sex relationships, which is news to us. I was raised in a two parent family with a mom and dad, perceived cis and het. Do you know of any resources for those who discover this news? It is all a shock to me, and I am not feeling judgement, but a lot of confusion, and sadness that I did not know this part of him, that he may have been hiding it, etc. Again, very sorry to intrude, and feel free to ignore, but am trying to find the right place to find others who have walked this path.

We have 6 books coming but we wanted to share our very first book - **[Daddy, Daddy, Is It True?](https://amzn.to/3cx5OgM)** &nbsp; The book is an opportunity to talk about colors and animals and we hope you like it. &nbsp; [Daddy, Daddy, Is It True?](https://amzn.to/3cx5OgM)",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,en
"Hi, Hope you all are doing well in these times. I'm looking for some advice and not exactly sure where to ask but came across this reddit and thought I'd give it a try. Background: my 12 year old niece is starting to enter that mildly rebellious phase of ""mom and dad don't know anything"" and her grandma is concerned. (Like, I'm talking about ""why CAN'T I stay up til 2am talking on the phone?"" rather than anything dangerous or frightening.) I've been tasked with looking for some kind of book for her to read that will ""encourage her to be obedient to her parents,"" in the evangelical Christian kind of sense. Having grown up in an intensely evangelical and conservative household and having read those kinds of books aimed at young girls (before I transitioned), I have a certain abhorrence for them, given that they tend to push a LOT of dogma that can be pretty dangerous to the reader - and tend to be pretty misogynist, patriarchal, heteronormative if not homophobic, etc. I don't want to waste money on that garbage, much less expose my niece to that. So I was wondering if you might have any suggestions for books or other media that might help a kid be able to work through being a teenager in a healthier kind of way. I don't think ""obey your parents, full stop"" is as helpful as giving them tools to work through personal problems, empathize with others, etc -- I would like her to have a healthy bond with her parents for sure. I thought I'd ask here since I figure same-sex parents might know about different resources and ways to help with this kind of thing without the trappings of dogma. (I'm not against religion or anything, just that particular kind of fundamentalist stuff.) Any and all advice or suggestions for other places that might be good to look would be really appreciated. Thanks a lot and stay safe.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,en

"Hi! I'm Zac. I'm a summer camp professional and trying to start my own camp for families with LGBTQ+ members in the South. I grew up in Kentucky as a bisexual person, and have worked in camps all over the south. Family camp is fairly traditional thing around here- that instead of just the kids, the whole family comes to camp for a weekend to enjoy the activities and fun. I realized that it was pretty unlikely that a family with same-sex parents would feel like this was a thing they could do in the south, without risking exclusion or negative interactions. The same for families with out children, or basically any family with a queer member who didn't want to go back into the closet for a weekend. I have some questions about how to do this best, if you might be willing to help me. &#x200B; 1. Is there a better way to say ""LGBTQ+ families""? Every attempt at verbiage I've tried comes out clunky and doesn't feel inclusive. 2. what are the best ways to reach families? I could be recruiting young single queer people all day, I'm surrounded by them, but talking to parents and families is a struggle. 3. My instinct is that this camp shouldn't have any sort of ""gay"" programming- that it should be a normal camp experience marketed at LGBTQ+ people. Would you, as a parent, want any sort of programming aimed specifically at talking through or learning about the challenges of being in a family with LGBTQ+ members ? Thanks so much.

"I am frustrated. I read news and opinion pieces about immigration at the Mexico/US border, and they all seem like they are using different data. Where can I get straight factual information to answer questions such as these? How many people have legally presented themselves for asylum each year for the past eight years? How many people have illegally crossed the border, on foot or by other means, over the same time period? How many asylum applicants have been detained, for how long, and how many have been accepted and how many have been denied? How many kids have been put in cages?

"I am on a dependent L2 VISA that expires in March 2021, but my Employment Authorisation Documents (EAD) expire on 08 December 2020. For the last two years, since getting an EAD, I had been working between India and US, but due to COVID was restricted to home-based work for organizations based in India or global ones (e.g. UN agencies). I was paying taxes on all my income in the US as ""US Income"". Now with the EAD coming to an end, I'm assuming I cannot continue to work while being in the US. Although all my current contracts come to an end before the EAD expires, I have more work lined up to complete. My next assignment is meant to start from December 2020 till March 2021. It is by a Global Organisation which can pay me anywhere I wish to get paid. All my payments will be made at the end of the service in March 2021. Could you tell me if any of the options are legally OK for me: 1. I get my future work contracts dated after 08 December 2020 with the address in India and get paid in India, but continue to do work from the US. 2. I get my future work contract dated after 08 December 2020 with the address in India, to be paid in India, and move to India physically to do the work at least until my VISA and EAD are renewed (January till March). 3.

I applied for a nomination for the Masters stream under OINP which is a Non Express entry Online application stream. I expect to get the Nomination in a couple of months.

"I'm so confused, I could vomit. We had a 30 minute phone consult with a lawyer today and while she was very kind and answered questions, the answers led to more questions after our call. And I'd really like to see if we could get any help here before paying more consult fees. The situation: a USC lives with their Canadian spouse in Canada. They both have citizen status in Canada but plan to move to the US, where obviously only one has any status. They'd land at a family home with the USC's family. The options as we understand them are: 1. We could apply while in Canada where both of us work. But how is ""financial support"" judged? From what we gather on [this travel.gov FAQ](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/the-immigrant-visa-process/step-1-submit-a-petition/i-864-affidavit-faqs.html#aos19), a USC can't financially sponsor a Canadian while domiciled outside the US. So what's the point? Would the USC need to move to the US first and get a new job in anticipation of the Canadian's arrival? 2. We could go to the US first and apply from there. But, this means BOTH will lose our jobs: the Canadian ironically has an employer that would keep them hired remotely in the US (not even the USC has that perk) but only if the Canadian can get their work auth squared away in the US within a reasonable time. The gap between leaving Canada and getting US work auth is probably too long, but processing timeframes are hazy. What would you do? Play it safe with employment with option 1 but not know if you'll qualify at the financial sponsor stage? Or sacrifice everyone's careers and go with option 2? The Canadian feels guilt for keeping the USC in Canada at this point. Their future awaits in the US, for several personal reasons. But we don't want to separate and we don't want fears lingering of possible screw-ups, deportation, rejection, and ultimately no progress in our lives. We want to do it right.

I honestly don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t think she‚Äö√Ñ√¥s doing it out of a hateful and vicious act. I think it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s just a phase; however, my partner is destroyed.

I think our daughter feels the tension and doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t want to say to her about stuff anything because she will be in trouble.

"My fiancee (NB, AFAB) and I (cis F) have been going back and forth about this for... a while. They're very much against me being pregnant because they're worried about my health and they have an aversion to me being pregnant with ""a stranger's baby"", and they can't get pregnant. Ever since I've been a kid I've wanted to be a mom, so we've been looking into different ways that we'll be able to build our family after we've been married for a few years. Adoption is something that we've been seriously considering. I have a degree in social work so I know how many older kids are in the system that need parents, but a selfish piece of me wants to adopt a baby because we only plan on having one and I want the all the parenting experience, the bad and the good. We are considering fostering teens at some point though! My worry with adoption stems from a group of very negative adult adoptees that I've come across who hated their adoptive parents simply because they adopted them and constantly said they would rather have their ""real"" parents raise them any day. I know that's not the common feeling, but it would hurt me if my child hated me just because I wanted to be their mother. I can handle teen angst ""I hate yous"" but if my child grew up still hating me because I didn't give birth to them I would break. The other option that we've been thinking about is finding a friend with sperm that might be able to donate to us, since my fiancee feels a little better about knowing the person who's DNA our child might share. The thing that worries me there is that even though I really want to be a mother, hospitals and pain and needles scare me. I really like the idea of a home water birth with a midwife, but that still leaves the pain. That fear might go away in time though? Has anyone here had that experience? I just thought I would come to some other gay parents and ask how you all did it! TL;DR - My fiancee and I are debating on how we want to expand our family in the future, and I have fears about both main options we're looking at.

"My husband and I became parents earlier this year when we adopted his cousin‚Äôs son after she passed away shortly after his second birthday. Like many parents we read a book to him before bed. One book he requests a lot is ‚ÄòAnd Tango Makes Three‚Äô which I‚Äôm sure many of us here are familiar with.

We were reading it again last night when our son pointed to one of the illustrations with the two father penguins and said, ‚ÄúDada, Baba.‚Äù and then pointed at the daughter penguin and said a term of endearment we often call him. And then he smiled. After putting him to bed, my husband and I definitely had a moment. Our son has a lot of trauma from losing his mother and then from coming to live with us and has struggled so much with it. At one time I was worried he would never be happy with us, and that we would never feel like family for him.

"My mother is elderly, has been diagnosed with dementia, and lives in an assisted care facility. Given her psychiatric state, I have power of attorney. My mother lives in Ohio, if that makes a difference. My mother has a Permanent Resident / Green Card immigration status, but is not a United States (US) Citizen. Because she is not a US citizen, she is not eligible to register to vote or vote in the upcoming general election. Without my knowledge, a voter registration drive occurred at the assisted care facility. My mother was given the impression that she was eligible to vote because she has a social security number. I learned today that my mother received a vote-by-mail absentee ballot and has successfully registered to vote, despite her Permanent Resident status. I have instructed the staff at the assisted care facility that my mother is not eligible to vote and to my knowledge, she hasn't returned the voting ballot.

"My wife and I are recently married and are in our early-mid 30s, so we're looking to have kids in the next few years. We've been looking into sperm donor and are debating whether it would be better to go with an anonymous vs known donor. We have two different gay male friends who have expressed interest in being sperm donors if they could have some sort of co-parenting relationship with us and the child. We hadn't ever thought about this option, as it doesn't seem to be very well documented in the media and most of our friends with kids are straight. In theory, we think it's kind of cool, as this was the way a lot of LGBT people parented before it was safe to be out, and we love thinking about alternative forms of kinship. It would be great for hypothetical kids to have a dad figure in addition to two moms and both friends who have expressed interest are great people who are very smart and empathetic and they would be great dads. However in practice we're not sure how it would work, both legally and in day-to-day life. It seems like we would need to very clearly define (perhaps in contract form) what role each party would play in the child's life and agree about parenting philosophies, custody, and where to build a home. In many ways it seems like an anonymous donor would be simpler, even though it costs more and we would have no idea whose sperm we were getting. I'm just wondering if anyone on this subreddit has experience with known donor/co-parenting situations, especially in an exchange sort of scenario with a gay male friend. We would be comfortable if, for instance, a friend donated sperm and one of us donated an egg/served as a surrogate and then we had like summer reunions where our kids were like cousins. Not sure how co-parenting platonically with an outside party would work or what that would entail. Part of me likes the idea of a nuclear family (even though two moms) because that's how I was raised, but am curious about how other arrangements would work. The first time a gay friend mentioned co-parenting we were surprised.

"Obviously a complete moratorium on immigration would be ideal but that is not going to happen. Realistically, what should the immigration policy of the United States look like? [The RAISE Act would have been a great step in the right direction.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAISE_Act) >The bill would cut legal immigration by half, reducing the number of green cards from more than 1 million to about 500,000. The bill would also remove pathways for siblings and adult children of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to apply for permanent lawful residency status in the U.S., limiting the family path to spouses and minor children. The bill would also impose a cap of 50,000 refugee admissions a year and would end the visa diversity lottery. >In addition to substantially reducing legal immigration to the United States, and dramatically reducing family-based immigration, the bill would also replace the current employment-based U.S. immigration system with a rigid points system, which would mark a departure from the current U.S. demand-driven model of employment-based immigration. Under the legislation, a maximum of 140,000 points-based immigrant visas would be issued per fiscal year, with spouses and minor children of the principal applicant being counted against the 140,000 cap. This is not enough though. It's difficult to say how low a cap on sheer number of green cards can get before it becomes too unrealistic but if 500,000 is realistic enough to be proposed to congress, something lower is probably still within the realm of possibility. We could probably go down to 400,000 and maybe 350 or 300,000. If 140,000 is realistic enough for points-based cap, we could lower it to 120 or 100,000. Birthright citizenship must also be repealed. This will take a supreme court that is on the side of the people. If Ginsberg dies while Trump is still in office, it could be made possible. [Trump's travel ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_travel_ban) should go much farther but what he accomplished with it is impressive and a sign of what is possible. >12 months after the implementation of the travel ban in 2018, only 537 immigrant visas were issued for individuals born in Iran. Whereas in 2017, 6643 visas were issued to Iranian born individuals, depicting a staggering 92% decrease in the 12 months following the travel ban. Iran wasn't the only Muslim country affected by the ban, other countries faced a similar effect. 12 months after the travel ban was in effect, Somalia experienced an 86% reduction in the number of immigrant visas and Yemen saw a decrease by 83%, Libya saw an 80% decrease and Syria 77%. Trump's ""Muslim ban"" never came about but immigration from countries that are enemies of the United States, sources of terrorism, and unstable is clearly constitutional and immigration from some countries were banned. Currently, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, and Somalia are the only countries banned but many others could potentially qualify. What if the US banned immigration from [all countries with ongoing armed conflicts?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_armed_conflicts) Citizens from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, India, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Russia, the Philipines, Afghanistan, Mexico, and many more would all be prevented from immigrating to the United States. This might be asking too much. We might be getting too unrealistic here by saying that all of these countries should be banned, especially Mexico and India. The point I'm trying to make is that a lot more countries can be banned, especially countries in the Islamic world and Sub-Saharan Africa. At the very least, we could try to ban immigration from the countries the 9/11 hijackers were from, e.g., Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Egypt, and United Arab Emirates. That may not work out though because Egypt and Saudi Arabia are important ""allies"" in the region. Sub-Saharan African countries like Nigeria, Cameroon, South Sudan, Chad, Mali, Ethiopia, or the DRC would be easier to ban. Alongside these bans, we could have a ""compromise"" that keeps the flow of immigration diverse by placing a cap on the number of people that can come in from each country. This could potentially prevent the number of immigrants coming into the US from ever reaching the total cap. [In 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States#Since_1965), Mexico sent 170,581 immigrants to the US. China sent 71,565. Cuba sent 65,028. India sent 60,394. I don't think placing a flat 50,000 cap on each country would work but we could place a cap of 25,000 on each country that sent over 50,000 in the past year. A number of countries (especially western ones) are already have very few people who desire to immigrate here and with the expanded travel ban, many a large portion of Islamic and Sub-Saharan African countries can send few to no immigrants to the US. Therefore, I don't think that a ""pro-diversity"" policy like what I'm suggesting here would actually make things that much diverse. Instead, it would just result in decreasing immigration as a whole by preventing China, India, Mexico, etc. from sending as many people as they do. [Approximately a third of migrants around the world are going back home](https://qz.com/1508145/a-new-study-shows-a-third-of-immigrants-are-going-back-home/) Why? Reasons include cultural issues, missing friends and families, new opportunities back home, the reason for leaving no longer existing (an end to war or regime change), loss of job, or preferring repatriation over dealing with ICE. By making family reunification and renewal of green cards more difficult, we can increase the number of people voluntarily leaving. Another important factor is automation. As the jobs low-skill immigrants do are replaced by machines, they are no longer needed by the rich and without a source of income, many will decide to return home. Not renewing green cards is more important than many people realize. If we cap the number of green cards, we can also cap the number of green card renewals, which will gradually uproot a large number of the foreigners currently residing in the United States. [**7.1% of the US population are not citizens.**](https://ballotpedia.org/State_demographics_by_citizenship_status) This number includes undocumented immigrants, legal permanent residents, and temporary workers. We can potentially change the permanence of their stay here in the US. We can continue to take in some immigrants but make sure that most of them also leave, turning our immigration system into a revolving door that prevents the demographics of the country from being further transformed. This is kind of vague because there's so many possible crimes that someone can commit but we should also be more strict when it come [Trump's health insurance requirements](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/health-insurance-test-green-card-applicants-could-sharply-cut-future-us-legal-immigration) for immigrants should also be a part of our immigration system since it ensures that those who come here will be able to stand on their own feet (at least when it comes to healthcare) and prevents a number of people from coming here. Require companies to use E-verify to ensure that their employees are not undocumented immigrants. I'm not sure what the penalty should be for those who break the law but obviously there should be something severe enough to prevent them from doing it. Lastly, no path for citizenship for undocumented immigrants. If you came in the wrong way, that's your fault and it's not fair to legal immigrants or the American people to give you a pass. Once anchor babies are no longer a problem, this will hopefully result in many undocumented immigrants losing hope and returning home. All of this could potentially decrease our annual intake of immigrants to below 300,000 and increase voluntary repatriation rates to levels that are much higher but not really possible for me to seriously estimate.

"So, I might be in the wrong place, but I wanted to get some advice from other parents. My daughter painted a picture for the family for Christmas that she says we have to open last. My youngest told my wife and I on the sly ""It's her announcement that she's a lesbian."" My daughter is 12, and she's often come up to us and proudly proclaimed herself various things over the years and we've never really taken them seriously. Usually, it's after she's learned a new term from a ""cool"" friend and they've decided that it applies to them. (""Oh, I like boy things and girl things, so I'm pansexual!"" No dear, that's not what that means.) It's led to many, MANY talks about gender vs sexuality, social ""norms"" vs reality, stereotypical gender roles and the such. I've also had to explain that her friends are idiots and that if she has questions about such things then she can ask us and not other 12 year olds. But here's my question; at what point should I just take her word for it? I don't want to demean her statement but frankly I'm never sure she actually knows what any of it means. Is 12 too young? Is it a normal age? I don't want to be that asshole dad, but a big part of me wants to tell her that I don't think she knows what the hell she is, and that is perfectly fine.",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,en

As are those who have been able to expedite their citizenship to Canada! **sorry on phone My child, & I have protection/restraining no contact orders from the child‚Äôs father protecting both of us. I am a US born citizen, although my father is a Canadian citizen. We‚Äôve both been to, and had plenty of communication with the Canadian Consulate office locally. Since 2013 no immigration officers have been in the states to help avoid biases. Any contact must be done via a phone call from a Canadian number; which isn‚Äôt hard with the amount of friends & family we have to patch in a call to them. My siblings & I are currently beginning to obtain our citizenship completed, mine being expedited, which allows my child automatic sponsorship. In the event that we are not going to remain protected, or my child not to be on a renewal order of protection our plans are to flee to Canada. I know that asylum is not an easy process, but as I have been told as a citizen and the risk of our safety, we have preference over anyone else to be able to ‚Äúreturn‚Äù to Canada and be provided with assistance for relocation (not a huge deal if we don‚Äôt as my father is able to help & commute over the boarder for work (he‚Äôs actually going to be remodeling our boarder crossing soon! If we are approved for asylum we have been told that we‚Äôd be met by police and other social service professionals to help aid us with our relocation. Does anyone have any information about this? It‚Äôs extremely RARE for Canadian citizens to have to seek aid in the return. Also if you know of anyone who has been able to do it without the asylum process with being a solo-parent? The passports are going to be key for us to just go, as I have sole legal and physical custody without being forced into informing my child‚Äôs father. Asylum is very serious. However with the conversations I have had with the immigration office closest to me, because of my citizenship situation I have automatic preference over others, and I am allowed to live in Canada during the time of being approved or not for asylum (there‚Äôs an admitted rape in the presence of our child with its own case that is in the initial order; and proof of everything) so I am just lucky to have the opportunity have dual citizenship no matter what, if this happened or not! Also having full guardianship/custody even if our child isn‚Äôt going to remain on a protective order until a family law trial which allows me PLENTY of time to flee legally!
