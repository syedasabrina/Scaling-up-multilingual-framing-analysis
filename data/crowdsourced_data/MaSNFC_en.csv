So we can help with inflation, but we’re going to need to do the hard things now. And I want to remind everybody that these farmers are families. Ninety-eight percent of farms in America are still family owned. They want the same thing for their families that we all want. Investing to address that, including labor, is so critically important—and will help alleviate some of that cost pressure.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,en

"As the title says, I applied for PR renewal around Jan 6, 2023. My application was returned to me and I received it today because there was some information missing (but I filled everything out and don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t see what‚Äö√Ñ√¥s missing even after checking the highlighted area). My main question and concern right now, is that I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m travelling out of the country in May and I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m worried I won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t receive my PR card before then. Our tickets are non refundable and we can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t change our itinerary (booked through AC). I know I can apply for a PRTD while I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m away, but I was wondering if I can still come back into Canada because I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m also an American citizen? Or does that not mean anything?

My sister has a multi-entry visitor visa. She originally came over just to visit which was the purpose she requested the visa for. Now she wants to re-enter and look for jobs. Is that allowed on a visitor visa? Will people interview you on a visitor visa or can you get into trouble as it may be seen as misrepresentation? I know she can't work on a visitor visa and I know there is a public policy to apply from a work permit without leaving Canada now.

I am planning to get married in my country and want to add my spouse to my application. The thing I am worried about is the proof of genuine relationship. It's an arranged marriage and I have not lived with my spouse. We met each other for 15 days when I went to my country. I came back afterwards. The problem is I don't have a lot of photos with her. We will be having a small reception gathering (20 people) when I will be doing my court marriage. Has anyone been in a similar situation.

Is that allowed on a visitor visa? Will people interview you on a visitor visa or can you get into trouble as it may be seen as misrepresentation? I know she can't work on a visitor visa and I know there is a public policy to apply from a work permit without leaving Canada now.

I am planning to get married in my country and want to add my spouse to my application. The thing I am worried about is the proof of genuine relationship. It's an arranged marriage and I have not lived with my spouse. We met each other for 15 days when I went to my country. I came back afterwards. The problem is I don't have a lot of photos with her. We will be having a small reception gathering (20 people) when I will be doing my court marriage. Has anyone been in a similar situation.

"I (31/M/Florida) met a Colombian woman in Florida when she came to visit some of her family. We had a relationship for about 4 months before she returned to Colombia in late December 2019. In early March she went to Spain to visit other family and is now stuck there due to COVID-19. We want to know the fastest legal process to get her back here so we can reunite and get married. COVID-19 aside (I know there is a lot still to be determined about international flight possibilities), what would the best/fastest option be for her to come and live with me in Florida? Tourist Visa? K-1 Visa? Is it illegal for me to marry her if she comes with a tourist visa? Is it the safest, however longer process to wait for specifically the K-1 visa process?

We will be having a small reception gathering (20 people) when I will be doing my court marriage. Has anyone been in a similar situation.

My sister has a multi-entry visitor visa. She originally came over just to visit which was the purpose she requested the visa for. Now she wants to re-enter and look for jobs. Is that allowed on a visitor visa? Will people interview you on a visitor visa or can you get into trouble as it may be seen as misrepresentation? I know she can't work on a visitor visa and I know there is a public policy to apply from a work permit without leaving Canada now. I just wanted to check if she is legally allowed to actively look for work on a visitor visa? Thanks!,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,en

My sister has a multi-entry visitor visa. She originally came over just to visit which was the purpose she requested the visa for. Now she wants to re-enter and look for jobs. Is that allowed on a visitor visa? Will people interview you on a visitor visa or can you get into trouble as it may be seen as misrepresentation? I know she can't work on a visitor visa and I know there is a public policy to apply from a work permit without leaving Canada now. I just wanted to check if she is legally allowed to actively look for work on a visitor visa? Thanks!,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,en

My sister has a multi-entry visitor visa. She originally came over just to visit which was the purpose she requested the visa for. Now she wants to re-enter and look for jobs. Is that allowed on a visitor visa? Will people interview you on a visitor visa or can you get into trouble as it may be seen as misrepresentation? I know she can't work on a visitor visa and I know there is a public policy to apply from a work permit without leaving Canada now. I just wanted to check if she is legally allowed to actively look for work on a visitor visa? Thanks!,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,en
